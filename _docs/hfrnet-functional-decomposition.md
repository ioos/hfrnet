TODO: Need a way of looking at this list of requirements and understanding the current state of our capabiliity.

1. Is the function currently implemented?
2. If yes, where
3. If not, who is the customer and how important is it?
4. If it's important, what part of the new system is most likely to implement it.  When?

Create a requirement allocation matrix with functions going down the rows and System containers/components across the top.  Containers = Portal 1, Portal 2, Portal SIO, Node SIO, Node NDBC, Website, THREDDS SIO, THREDDS NDBC, ERDDAP etc.  Color code existing functions differently from future functions.

Green are mandatory in Phase 1 (prior to 6/30/2025), Yellow could be delayed until Phase 2 (viz. in years 2â€“3 of operation), and Red could be delayed to Phase 3 (viz. post-Year 3)
