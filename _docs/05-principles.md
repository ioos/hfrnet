- Multi-stage migration
- Change the fewest number of system components as possible during each stage of the migration.
- Open source code for all system functions 
- Open project planning to encourage transparency and invite contributions. (Create ioos/hfrnet github repository to serve as the master repo for planning and version control.  OK to create new repos to facilitate a modular and open architecture.  e.g. separate "science code" from "synchronizing and monitoring data flow")
- Provide access to all data types, not just the end product.
