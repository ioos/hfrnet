The HFRNet system is the information management system that collects raw data from ~165 High Frequency Coastla Radar sites around the country and processes it into national products that serve various [users](./users) needs.  

- What is this software project/product/system all about?
- What is it thatâ€™s being built?
- How does it fit into the existing environment? (e.g. systems, business processes, etc) -  Who is using it? (users, roles, actors, personas, etc)

TODO update and insert context diagram with HFRNet and main external software systems.  Probably worth describing the difference between software systems that serve as a conduit to users, and the end users themselves.  For example, NWTSG -> GTS -> global NMHS.  Or WSTG -> AWIPS (tools used by WFOs).
