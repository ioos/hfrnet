# Context

A context section should be one of the first sections of the software guidebook and simply used to set the scene for the remainder of the document.

## Intent
A context section should answer the following types of questions:

- What is this software project/product/system all about?
- What is it that’s being built?
- How does it fit into the existing environment? (e.g. systems, business processes, etc) -  Who is using it? (users, roles, actors, personas, etc)

## Structure

The context section doesn’t need to be long; a page or two is sufficient and a context diagram is a great way to tell most of the story.

## Motivation

I’ve seen software architecture documents that don’t start by setting the scene and, 30 pages in, you’re still none the wiser as to why the software exists and where it fits into the existing IT environment. A context section doesn’t take long to create but can be immensely useful, especially for those outside of the team.

## Audience

Technical and non-technical people, inside and outside of the immediate software develop- ment team.

## Required

Yes, all software guidebooks should include an initial context section to set the scene.


- [ ] TODO update and insert context diagram with HFRNet and main external software systems.  Probably wirth describing the difference between software systems that serve as a conduit to users, and the end users themselves.  For example, NWTSG -> GTS -> global NMHS.  Or WSTG -> AWIPS (tools used by WFOs).
